{{% notice warning %}}
The Cloud9 workspace should be built by an IAM user with Administrator privileges,
not the root account user. Please ensure you are logged in as an IAM user, not the root
account user.

{{% notice info %}}
This workshop was designed to run in the **Oregon (us-west-2)** region. **Please don't
run in any other region.** Future versions of this workshop will expand region availability,
and this message will be removed.

{{% notice tip %}}
Ad blockers, javascript disablers, and tracking blockers should be disabled for
the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted.
Cloud9 requires third-party-cookies. You can whitelist the [specific domains]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-env-loading).

### Launch Cloud9:
Create a Cloud9 Environment: [https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home?region=us-west-2](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home?region=us-west-2)

{{% notice warning %}}
Make sure you are naming your Cloud9 environment `AppMesh-Workshop`, otherwise things will break later.
{{% /notice %}}

- Select **Create environment**
- Name it **AppMesh-Workshop**, and take all other defaults
- When it comes up, customize the environment by closing the **welcome tab**
and **lower work area**, and opening a new **terminal** tab in the main work area:
![c9before](/images/c9before.png)

- Your workspace should now look like this:
![c9after](/images/c9after.png)

- If you like this theme, you can choose it yourself by selecting **View / Themes / Solarized / Solarized Dark**
in the Cloud9 workspace menu.


### Increase the disk size on the Cloud9 instance

```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade boto3
export instance_id=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
python -c "import boto3
import os
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
volume_info = ec2.describe_volumes(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'attachment.instance-id',
            'Values': [
                os.getenv('instance_id')
            ]
        }
    ]
)
volume_id = volume_info['Volumes'][0]['VolumeId']
try:
    resize = ec2.modify_volume(    
            VolumeId=volume_id,    
            Size=30
    )
    print(resize)
except ClientError as e:
    if e.response['Error']['Code'] == 'InvalidParameterValue':
        print('ERROR MESSAGE: {}'.format(e))"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    sudo reboot
fi

```

- *Note*: The above command is adding more disk space to the root volume of the EC2 instance that Cloud9 runs on. Once the command completes, we reboot the instance which could take a minute or two for the IDE to come back online.
